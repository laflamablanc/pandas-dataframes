Is it eligible??  It's a race to zero for distro companies and although this pitch is very impressive I am unsure how it is any better than the market leading competitors.  Name dropping a lot of big clients/customers for a product that has grossed under 200k.  If Avid and Dolby distro are 'biassed on this companies tech' and licensed from them, i struggle to see how this company will grow to generate and significant revenue.

This application is slightly better than one of the American ones through working with employers. But they have entered a very confusing reply on traction, having put 10k users but no answer on revenue.

Since they get users by signing up with employers, it seems odd to have no revenue yet but have over 10k users.

I am very concerned that whilst these platforms are meant to do good, they can add to the already existing huge problem of debt in some communities"

However, I do worry about the implications of allowing advances on salaries and if it may lead to bad money habits or issues for those without proper cash management skills. I would assume that the company is protecting itself from any liabilities related to this or offering budgeting workshops for those interested in that. All in all, I like the idea because you are right if you have already worked the hours you should be entitled to access those funds when needed. This platform seems to facilitate that interaction.

ApertureDB,2021,Enterprise & Smart Data,11264,Anna	Thomlinson,3,No,"I have seen two other startups going through accelerator programmes that offer the same service, and they have both found that occasionally a buyer is interested in consulting in this area but not in longer term purchasing via the platform. So, if I've already known two startups with this problem then there will be more out there meaning that this limits the score for creativity and potential. This is one of those instances where I think you have a good business. Whether you've got a good scaleable business - I haven't been convinced"

Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Bobbie Carlton,2.4,No,Feels like an add-on service for a company that offers training not a true stand alone product.
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Ben Clayton,3.8,No,"Close call. I don't understand the monthly membership plan. Of all the pitches I have created, they were one and done - no need to be on a monthly anything. Traction is not very good for almost 2 years since launching. Also, I sure would have loved to have seen a pitch video for this pitch!"
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Craig Elias,2.4,Yes,I'm on the fence with this one but learning to pitch is hard and there is a significant portion of the market is looking for the easy way out.
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Anna	Thomlinson,2.4,No,"It is less convincing that they have Startup Bootcamp as one of their 3 customers when you realise that one of the founders worked there. 

This is a very low amount of revenue for the length of time that they have been operating. There is a lot more competition in this market than they reference. This doesn't seem like a high growth market"
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Maren	Lesche,3,No,Looks like the subscription model is only for incubators and accelerators. This solution is also very mature. Launched in 03/2019 but many essential features are still in the testing mode.
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Elisa	Sepulveda,2.4,No,There needs to be a more narrow focus for who the initial customer market is. Marketing to both startups and large companies changes the use case for building a pitch deck. I want to see more focus on a smaller market to prove the concept.
Pitchy,2021,Future of Work,11216,Jessica	Moose,3.8,Yes,A helpful tool for startups looking to attract investment. This also allows for some standardization in pitch deck creation.

Zendit,2021,Future of Work,11224,Anna	Thomlinson,2.8,No,This is a nice concept but it is too early days to see if they will start to convince decent number of people to change how they work. This will be very difficult to launch. It would be good to see them return next year with traction
Zendit,2021,Future of Work,11224,Maren	Lesche,2.8,Yes,the business model does not make sense but the thought behind it is interesting
Zendit,2021,Future of Work,11224,Dalia	Kamar,3.8,No,"Really cool concept but tough with the current email platforms. The ability for Google, Outlook or whatsapp to do this in a day would make this obsolete "
Zendit,2021,Future of Work,11224,Elisa	Sepulveda,2.2,No,Not far enough along in their development. They have no paying customers and I want to see some stickiness with their product given how crowded this space is with behemoth incumbents.
Zendit,2021,Future of Work,11224,Nadyli	Nunez,2.2,No,What about when you have a thread with multiple people and you want to reply to one for something and then reply-all for the other? I don't think this will be adopted.

TextBadge,2021,Future of Work,11238,Bobbie Carlton,3.2,No,It looks like the company pivoted to a COVID tracking application or may just be starting there.

TextBadge,2021,Future of Work,11238,Jessica	Moose,4.4,No,What a great service for workplace safety in general. I appreciate how the company pivoted to covid testing in light of the pandemic and think that the potential for a company like this is great in riskier/hazardous occupations.

Cybint Bootcamp,2021,Future of Work,11255,Craig Elias,2.6,Yes,While it seems to be nothing more than outsourced content for a school they have traction and the market does appear to be underserved.
Cybint Bootcamp,2021,Future of Work,11255,Anna	Thomlinson,4.6,Yes,"This is a nice way to retrain people for careers in areas where there is plenty of work. And it is being run by a very experienced team. Strong traction since they started to productise.

Technically, the company has existed for longer than within the rules, but they only created the scaleable, productised version of what they offer within the last two years"

My concern is the founders aren't thinking big enough yet... their competition isn't just guide books, its fishing / outdoor clubs, tripadvisor, AirBnB.

I love that they are serial founders who have exited, so I think this kind of opportunity at SXSW can really help them level up their business."

Guardiian App,2021,Innovative World Technologies,11101,Kathleen Baireuther,3,No,Really interesting concept and wireframe. I'd like to see more developed partnerships with legal agencies/citizen protection groups that can ensure that this data is used appropriately and that it is verifiable. There may also be PII issues if protestors are using an app like this in a hostile context. Could this be used against people vs. for them?

Macro,2021,Future of Work,11104,Ben Clayton,4.4,Yes,"Yes, due to its high score, though reluctant as it's an add-on to another platform (zoom). Their success in raising capital helps."

Macro,2021,Future of Work,11104,Elisa	Sepulveda,2.4,No,Lots of competition in this space right now and it's really unclear how they are different aside from the UI. Traction numbers are also confusing -- are people actually using it?
Macro,2021,Future of Work,11104,Nadyli	Nunez,3.8,Yes,"Zoom is not just for work anymore, it is also for socializing. I think this format gives a breath of fresh air to the usual Zoom format. This will be useful for work more than social, however. Rally.video does a better job at the networking component of it all. Their price point is unclear and that will influence whether people will be willing to make the switch as the features are nice but may not be enough to pay more for (unless the target are companies with those means)"
Macro,2021,Future of Work,11104,Rosario	B Casas,3.4,Yes,I disagree with the vision of what causes zoom fatigue but liked the solution's design and interactivity component. I am not sure about the numbers (paying clients vs. revenue). Great financing round closed.

It's going to be tough. yes to this one because it's a team of 5 family members as founders and it's a feel good company that could show well. "
KOYA,2021,Social & Culture,11143,Jennifer	Tacheff,4,Yes,"Aw! I love this idea. It's like marco polo meets amazon gifts/ubereats in a moment and I believe the traction will go far beyond pandemic. Consumers are used to immediacy nowadays and connectivity so many of us are doing something like this anyway without a platform, however it's workarounds and not a seamless experience. The team seems solid and the brand is clear. This is a ""yes"" for me!"

"Virtual Space ""oVice""",2021,Future of Work,11148,Jessica	Moose,3.8,Yes,A platform such as this needs high visibility in order to become successful in the US. SXSW would give them that.

Those type of DJs however wouldn't be interested in playing songs people requested, tip jars, or even taking the time between sets to pick things as nowadays most music is already premixed anyway (or an existing Spotify/SoundCloud playlist that anyone can play).

It sounds like it will be difficult to get it to the stage of having a sustainable business model in comparison to the answer given. It is rare to be able to deliver one programme for millions because of the need to localise the content, because of the students' interests in options in what they learn, and because of competition in the market challenging what should be in the curriculum. The affect of this needs more careful consideration. The details of the team could be stronger in comparison to other applications.

Clair,2021,Future of Work,11330,Anna	Thomlinson,3.6,No,"There is another startup doing the same as this, Lendtable, which has better traction and VC backing so I am putting that one through instead of this one. There is no doubt that the intentions of setting up a company like this is to help a societal challenge. It is a shame that the team does not include someone who seems to have more experience in this area. Coupled with going for the VC growth route and being accessible via a digital bank, means that this project risks not finding the language, partnerships and eventually people most in need but supports most those for whom there is the most money to be made, which is the people who have a greater income and spend more, which is where the money for this company is made. I'd like to be convinced that the reality will in future will be different. This scores lower for creativity since this is a small level of innovation on the competitors.

Similar to Birdie (another applicant this year) the incredible challenge of getting past SEO add word search to have people find your app and then you and all your friends be on the same one to make recommendations to each other.

WalknTravel,2021,"Smart Cities, Transportation & Logistics",11361,Jan	Bormans,2.2,No,"The idea behind this startup is good (extracting info from the users' social media to propose them personalised tours/travel).
However, it is not sufficiently clear whether consumers would accept the proposed approach (browsing, approving and paying for a travel/tour in 5-10 min).
It is also not well explained how sufficient content will be available on the platform (esp. the ""experience"" part)."
WalknTravel,2021,"Smart Cities, Transportation & Logistics",11361,Leah	Simoncelli,2,No,Idea stage; how is this different than typing a few things in Google Maps?
WalknTravel,2021,"Smart Cities, Transportation & Logistics",11361,Umesh Kumar,2.4,No,"Nice idea. No traction, weak team, extremely fragmented market but no clear path to growth or scalability. One to look at in the future perhaps. "
